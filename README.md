JavaScript Video Poker by Sean Normoyle

Simple JavaScript implementation of video poker. Mostly doing this to keep busy with a code project outside of work, 
where I mostly work on .NET server-side stuff.

TODO:
[ ] adaptive display
[ ] hold/unhold cards
[ ] add deal button
[ ] add reset button
[ ] add money counter
[ ] save money in session data? might be good practice
[ ] add hand-checking logic
[ ] tests for all hand-checking logic
[ ] cards need to track display location and/or deal order in order to swap in/out the correct card (will be sorted in hand 
    but not on screen).
